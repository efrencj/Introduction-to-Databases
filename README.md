# Introduction

This repository contains my work from the **Introduction to Databases** course. It was an interesting subject where I took my first steps into the world of databases and **SQL (Oracle)**.

## Learning Experience

Throughout the course, I learned how to design and manage databases efficiently. I worked extensively with **SQL queries** and used **Oracle Data Modeler** to create structured database models. While the subject required effort, it was not the most difficult to pass, and I was able to grasp the key concepts with practice.

This course helped me understand **how databases function, how to structure data efficiently, and how to write optimized queries**, which are essential skills for any developer.

## Conclusion

Looking back, this course was a valuable introduction to database management. It provided me with fundamental skills in **SQL and database design**, which will be useful in future projects.  
This repository serves as a reflection of my learning process and progress in database management.
